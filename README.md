# twitter-hashtag-search-notebook
A simple notebook for searching Twitter (assuming you have a developer account and active credentials)

## Pre-requisites
For this notebook to work, you need a Twitter developer account and active credentials for authorisation to access the Twitter API. If you do not have a Twitter developer account, then you can sign up on the Twitter [Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/en). If you have a Twitter developer account, but do not have active credentials, then you need to follow step two in the above link to acquire your API key and secret (also known as Consumer Key and Secret) and user Access Token (key) and Secret.

## To run locally
If you want to run locally, ensure you have Python 3 installed and your terminal is open in the `twitter-hashtag-search-notebook` directory, and try running the following commands:
`python3 -m venv .env`
`source .env/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install jupyter`
`jupyter notebook`
